- Single pieces of informations get stored in varibles and constants.
- Very important and used over most of our code.

Introduction:

## What is a Variable?

- Any application that we write is going to be nased on data.
- If we're selling products we need data on the product name, on the produc price and all the data that belongs to a price or purchase order.
- If you're writing a product that runs within a car you might need access to such asd speed vehicle or just anything about that vehicle.
- Likewise with a game, you might need data such as the highScore or the images used for the players animation
- Data is Stored in Computer Memory
- It's up to us to come up with variable names

## Declaring Variables

- We need to let to JS know with what variables we are going to be working with
- And the terminology we use for that is **"Declaring Variables"**
- When we **"Declare a Variable"** we use a keyword
- let total = 119.99;
- A **keyword** is a special symbol that JS know about **let**, **const**, **var**. It performs some type of action
- After the keyword we have **"Variable Name"** that we want to use
- What the **"="** sign does, is it takes the value and asigns it to the variable

- let product = 'Hiking Boots';
- A **string** 'Hiking Boots' - our Computers and Devices have no idea whar Hiking Boots are so by putting them in quotes we can just treat the text as literal text. We can put any words we'd like in quotes

- let discounted = true;
- **boolean** Values - true and false

## Naming Variables

- Give out variables descriptive names
- Certain rules to follow when naming our variables
- Valid Variable Names:
  - Start With One Of: \_, $, letter
  - Followed by Zero or More: $ letter number
  - Cannot Begin With: A number
  - Cannot have spaces between them

## Common Errors Using Variables

- Certain rules that are vewry common when using variables. How to detect them and correct them.

## Changing Variable Values

- The reason a variable is called a variable is because the value changes or varies over time.

## What is a Constant?

- Very similar with a variable but they can only have one value that never change

## The var keyword
